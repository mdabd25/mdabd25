A Physics post-graduate from IISER Berhampur, currently working as an ML Research Intern at **Intel Corporation**. I'm passionate about the intersection of Machine Learning and resource-constrained embedded systems (TinyML). I also do have a keen more interest in quantitative finance. My goal is to leverage cutting-edge AI to solve complex, real-world problems.

### üî≠ What I'm Currently Working On

As part of my internship at Intel, I'm focused on:
-   Analyzing and optimizing the performance of state-of-the-art computer vision models for specialized edge processors.
-   Developing model compression techniques (quantization, pruning) in Python using the OpenVINO toolkit.
-   Benchmarking models to drive performance for efficient, on-device AI solutions.

### ‚ú® Featured Project: My MS Thesis

**Gesture Recognition Framework on a PSoC 6 Microcontroller**

This was my Master's thesis project, where I designed and built an end-to-end TinyML system for real-time gesture classification on a highly resource-constrained dual ARM Cortex-M microcontroller (PSoC 6).

-   üß† **Model:** Trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in TensorFlow and applied post-training quantization to drastically reduce its size.
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Deployment:** Deployed the optimized model using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, writing the complete firmware in **Embedded C** using Modustoolbox software to handle sensor data and inference.
-   üöÄ **Result:** Achieved **~90% classification accuracy** on a custom dataset, operating entirely within the MCU's **1MB of flash and 288KB of RAM**.

### üå± Beyond the Code

-   **Sports:** When I'm not at a computer, you can find me on the court or field playing football, badminton, or basketball.
-   **Interests:** I'm an avid watcher of travel vlogs and am manifesting creating my own one day! When I'm not optimizing neural networks, I'm working on optimizing my own trading strategies in Forex market.
-   **Reading:** I enjoy a mix of genres, but a book that is currently resonating with me is *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant*.
-   **Ambition:** My long-term vision is to build a quantitative trading firm right here in India.
